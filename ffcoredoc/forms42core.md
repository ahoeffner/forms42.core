## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [Alert](./forms42core.alert.md) | A popup form to alert the user that some event has occured |
|  [AlertForm](./forms42core.alertform.md) |  |
|  [AnyOf](./forms42core.anyof.md) | Filters is a key component when communicating with a backend. The AnyOf filter resembles the in operator in SQL. |
|  [Between](./forms42core.between.md) | Filters is a key component when communicating with a backend. The Between filter resembles the between operator in SQL. |
|  [BindValue](./forms42core.bindvalue.md) | <p>Bind values is meant for use with datasources, espicially databases where they act as a placeholder for a given value. Bind values can be both as one-way in or two-way in/out.</p><p>When used with OpenRestDB the data type is determined by the table column it is bound to (initially same as name). However it is not always possible to determine the datatype based on the datasource.</p><p>In rare cases it is necessary to force or cast the data type to a different type than the datasource's default data type.</p> |
|  [Block](./forms42core.block.md) | <p>Intersection between datasource and html elements</p><p>All generic code for a block should be put here, ie Lookups Triggers List of values etc</p> |
|  [CanvasConfig](./forms42core.canvasconfig.md) | <p>Forms must be placed on a canvas. This is to ensure that the form can be blocked when for instance a LOV is active. It also provides means for moving, hiding etc.</p><p>Some styling of the canvas is necessary but made public through this class. It is also possible for expert users to replace the canvas class completely if needed.</p> |

|  [Contains](./forms42core.contains.md) | Filters is a key component when communicating with a backend. The Contains filter is meant for text-queries. Contains is not part of standard SQL and should be extended when used on a database datasource |
